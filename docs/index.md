# QSD.MATHS.OBSIDIAN

The site was engined by `material for mkdocs`.

There are various migration issues, such as Admonition support, $\latex$ support, backlink now showing, etc. QSD will look into it when he has the mood.

But very thankful to have such a wonderful, free and easy-to-use markdown-to-static-html engine.
